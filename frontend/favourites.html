                <p>Ragi mudde, ragi sangati or kali, colloquially simply referred to as either mudde or hittu which
                    means 'lump' or 'dough', is a finger millet swallow dish of India in the state
                    of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (Rayalaseema region). In Tamil Nadu, especially in western Tamil
                    Nadu, it is also called ragi kali. Ragi mudde is the main food in Kolar, Mandya, Hassan, Mysore,
                    Tumkur, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagar districts in Karnataka and Rayalaseema Region in Andhra Pradesh.
                    A similar variation known as dhindo is also eaten in Northeast India, Nepal and Bhutan.
                    In Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh in northern India, a similar variation is known
                    as baadi and baari respectively.
                    Ragi mudde is rich in the same nutrients that are found in finger millet, namely fibre, calcium, and
                    iron.</p>

                <p>The name "bisi bele bath" translates to "hot lentil rice dish" in Kannada. Bisi bele bath, a spicy,
                    rice-based dish from the state of Karnataka , is said to have originated in the Mysore Palace.
                    The dish is said to have been created in the palace kitchens 300 years ago. It was originally a
                    non-vegetable dish made with ingredients like cloves, turmeric, tamarind, cashew nuts, dried
                    coconut, mustard seeds, and cinnamon. The dish took 100 years to leave the palace kitchens and
                    another 200 years to spread across the state. It eventually made its way to the vegetarian eateries
                    of Udupi in western Karnataka, where a vegetable-laden version was created.</p>

                <p>Mysore pak was first prepared in the kitchens of the Mysore Palace during the regime of Krishna Raja
                    Wadiyar IV, by a palace cook named Kakasura. When asked its name, Madappa had nothing in mind,
                    simply called it the Mysuru paka. Pak (or paka, more precisely) in Kannada means "sweet". It is
                    traditionally served in weddings and other festivals of southern India, and is very popular in baby
                    showers as well.
                    There are many varieties of Mysore Pak, including beet, carrot, cashew, dates, milk, and special

                <p>The history of Maddur vada is one of accidental invention and popularity with railway passengers:
                    In 1917, Ramachandra Budhya, who ran a Vegetarian Refreshment Room (VRR) at Maddur railway station,
                    invented Maddur vada. When a train arrived early and he didn't have time to prepare pakoras, he
                    rolled the dough flat and fried it. Maddur vada has a slightly hard crust and a soft core. The
                    chopped onions add a memorable taste.</p>

                <p>Davanagere Benne masala Dose has an interesting history dating back to 1928. A lady named Chennamma
                    migrated to Davanagere with her children and started preparing Dosa, Chutney and Potato Palya with
                    her own unique recipe. She started her tiny eatery in front of Savalagi Drama Theater near Vasantha
                    Talkies at Davanagere which became popular for its taste.</p>
                <p>Initially, she used to prepare Dosa with Ragi batter. Later by 1938, her children started preparing
                    Dosa with Rice batter, puffed rice and dal with generous dollops of butter. This became extremely
                    popular with locals very soon. This was carried on by Chennamma's two sons Shanthappa and
                    Mahadevappa. They both opened their own eateries. Shanthappa opened his eatery in 1944 called
                    "Shantappa Dosa Hotel" and this is the oldest Benne Dose eatery of Davanagere located near Clock
                    Tower in Old Davanagere. This is presently run by his son Ganesh.
                    Apart from these, there are many popular eateries serving delicious Benne Dosa in Davanagere.
                    Popular amongst them are Sri. Guru Kottureshwara Benne Dosa Hotel, Gayathri Benne Dosa Hotel,
                    Vasantha Benne Dosa Hotel, etc...</p>

                <p>The history of filter coffee, also known as kaapi, is connected to the introduction of coffee to
                    India by a Sufi saint named Baba Budan.</p>
                <p>Legend has it that Baba Budan smuggled seven raw coffee beans back to India from Mecca in the 16th or
                    17th century. He planted the beans in the Chikmagalur hills of Karnataka, where the climate was
                    favorable for growing coffee. The hills were later named Baba Budangiri, or "Baba Budan Hills". In
                    the 20th century, coffee became popular in other South Indian states, such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra
                    Pradesh, and Kerala. The drink became more popular when it was mixed with milk and sweeteners like
                    honey or jaggery.</p>

                    century. The dish is said to have originated when Maratha soldiers needed a nutritious and tasty
                    meal during
                    the 17th century.
                    Some say that the dish was introduced by Maratha Mannaji Rao, the owner of Shivaji Military Hotel,
                    which was established in 1935.</p>
                <p>The dish is named after the donne, which are dried leaf bowls made from the areca nut palm.</p>

                <p>TJolada Rotti or bread made from Sorghum is a staple diet in North Karnataka and a must try when in
                    Karnataka. Sorghum, the grain used to make jolada rotti, has been cultivated in India for centuries.
                    Its cultivation likely predates the origin of the flatbread itself. Jolada Rotti is an oil free,
                    nutritious food.
